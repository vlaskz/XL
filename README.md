# XL

Script made in Python3 which uses Win32 API, COM Objects, Excel Workbooks and a lot of iterations to transform Bradesco's financial data from one account into valid reports to my CFO.

### Future updates:
* Adding NetEmpresa's Scrapping for auto-fetch of data.
* Adding e-mail sending, so I don't have to. Laziness is a good thing if you like programming. Good programmers are lazy. Effort in programming often means you're not interested in optimization.
* Create an OS-independent (Java, is that you in the end of tunnel, or just that smart kiddo, your younger sibling .NET Core?) implementation.

### Notes:
* You HAVE to use Windows to use this. or to reprogram the ```convert_xls_xlsx``` function.
* You will need the `pywin32`, `openpyxl` to use this, so, bother use that thing(the PIP):
  * `py -m pip install pywin32`
  * `py -m pip install openpyxl`
* You can give me kudos if something in this organized mess was useful.
* Or offer me a job. I'm currently looking for one in software/hardware(I have some skills in electronic engineering!) development
